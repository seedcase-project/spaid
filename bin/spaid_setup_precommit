Usage: `basename $0` [-h]

Run this command to setup pre-commit on the repository. It will:

- Install pre-commit hooks
- Do an initial run of the pre-commit hooks on all the files

This command only works if:

- you are in a local Git repository
- the repository has a file called '.pre-commit-config.yaml'

Examples:

    spaid_setup_precommit
"

if [[ "$1" == "-h" ]] ; then
    echo $help_text
    exit 0
fi

precommit_file=$(pwd)/.pre-commit-config.yaml

if [[ ! -f "$precommit_file" ]]
then
    echo "Error: No '$precommit_file' found. You need to create one to continue."
    exit 1
fi

# Install pre-commit hooks as defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
uvx pre-commit install
uvx pre-commit run --all-files
